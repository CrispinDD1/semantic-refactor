# semantic-refactor

## Description 

As a bootcamp student, I want to become more familiar with reading code and understanding semantic structure. In this repo you will find a refactored version of a starter code used to familirize myself with html and css. I altered the code using semantic elements and addressed some webpage errors along with formating the html into an organized fashion.
